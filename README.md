# thermal_screening_project
Camera based thermal screening using opencv in python(a computer vision library).
The aim of this project is to identify the temperatures at points in an image taken by cameras such as security cameras. This can be used to automate fever detection. Certain image processing operations such as thresholding, masking, dilation and erosion, contours have been applied in a suitable manner to process the image morphologically. At last temperatue is estimated by dividing with a constant.
The raw image used for work and the result image are both provided in the folders.
This project has been made with the assistance of "AIChamp by CV Labs" - www.aichamp.in
